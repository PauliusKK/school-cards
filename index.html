        <h5>WEEK 1 & 2 — If You Want to Be a Profitable Player, You Need The Following...</h5>
        <h2>Establishing a Solid Foundation and a Range Based Thought Process</h2>
        <p>Considering the fact that the entire game of poker revolves around the process of trying to figure out what your opponents have... That is the skillset we are going to start with.  An opponent's range construction is usually something that comes later in most poker courses, which is something that doesn’t really make a lot of sense. We will work on understanding this crucial aspect of poker from week 1 on.</p>

                <p>One of the most important factors in improvement is knowing where you are and where you want to go. We will do a complete 360 analysis of your game so that you can compare your thought process before and after the training.

                <h4>Establishing a Solid Foundation and a Range Based Thought Process</h4>
                <p>The average poker player knows what a range is. However, very few players actually have a range based approach to poker. The entire course, particularly the first two weeks, is dedicated towards getting you to determine a thought process that revolves around actively narrowing your opponent's range throughout a hand. Trust me...the game is much easier to play when you can deduce what your opponents have.</p>

                <p>When beginner players consider the math involved in poker they usually refer to odds. Most players have no idea how math or more specifically combinatorics can be used to breakdown and express an opponent's range. Its one of the most overlooked aspects of understanding ranges and we will cover it extensively.</p>

                <h4>How to Develop a System Based Thought Process</h4>
                <p>Poker is a game that requires you to think about a wide range of variables. But what do you think about first? Which variables are the most important? When should you ignore certain things at the table? There are so many questions that come up for players because they aren’t actually thinking in a systematic fashion when they sit down and play. Developing a systematic approach will allow us to process the available information and make the most profitable decision possible over time.</p>

                <p>Many players set out to learn and improve at this game but they waste so much time because their approach is flawed. If we are going to spent the next 10 weeks improving our game, I want to start by showing you how 5 simple learning tactics will help you continually improve during and beyond this course.</p>

        <h5>PHASE 2 - Weeks 3, 4 and 5</h5>
        <h2>Master the Fundamentals of Poker and Establish a Rock Solid Foundational Game</h2>
        <p>Foundations are everything in poker. Before you open your range, before you get to play a more exploitive and creative style; you need to master a solid and foundational game. Most players have such big problems with the fundamentals that they can’t truly improve or grow. We will dedicate 3 weeks towards making sure your foundation is solid. This is a level of dedication and diligence towards mastering the game that most players can not say that they have fostered.</p>

                <h4>How to Leverage a Positional Edge</h4>
                <p>Every semi-decent poker player understands the concept of position. Players know they should play in position, but really don’t understand why. We will re-work your understanding of position from the ground up so that you can understand how to take advantage of players who don’t don't have a thorough understanding of positional strategy. When you are done with the course you will not only understand the bigger aspects of position, but your game will reflect a positional edge.</p>

                <h4>Spec Hands Specialty</h4>
                <p>J9, QT, 79… These hands have a ton of value. The problem is the value is relative to your opponents, your ability to play post flop, stack size, position, etc. Adding speculative hands into your range is essential to a well rounded game. You just need to learn exactly how to think about and recognize the value, which is exactly what we will teach you to do.</p>

                <h4>How to Extract Maximum Value</h4>
                <p>Extracting maximum value is one of the most creative processes in poker. Fortunately for us, most players lack the creativity to do this well. You will learn exactly how to understand your opponents and properly time and size your bets. This will allow you to extract the most profit from each and every hand you choose to play.</p>

                <h4>How to Navigate the Ax Dynamic</h4>
                <p>Ax hands can get tricky. AK on a A29 board… Not that hard to play. However, what happens when you miss that ace on the flop.. Then what? Learn how to think through the Ax spots so you can understand how to play these hands profitably when you don’t connect with the flop of your dreams.</p>

                <h4>How did The Cash Game Fix Improve Your Game?</h4>
                <p>Ever since I started coaching poker I have discussed the reason that the word “why” is the most important word in poker. The reality is most players raise, fold, or call with a minimal amount of information driving their decisions. Poker is a game of decisions and behind each decision is a WHY. Understanding and being able to express precisely WHY you chose one decision over another during a hand is the real secret to continual improvement in poker. We will make sure you have solid reasons behind your decisions at the table.</p>

          <p>Listen, let’s be clear here. I can’t guarantee that you are all of a sudden going to turn into the best poker player in the world. Anyone selling you any product that guarantees stuff like that is full of shit.</p>
          <p>What I can guarantee is that if you take the training and do the work, Beyond Tells will be the best investment you have ever made in your game. The information you get from reading behavior will significantly elevate your skills, allowing you to pay for the product so many times over. I am so confident in what I am offering because I have personally seen the incredile results experienced by hundreds of players.</p>
          <p>And let me say this one last time: there is absolutely NO RISK. If you are not amazed at the quality of Beyond Tells - send us an email at any time time during the first 30 days and I will give you a full refund. No questions asked. No hard feelings.</p>

          <h2>The Live Class Archive</h2>
          <p class="main-p">In May of 2017, I conducted my last live poker class. I invited students from the Cash Game Fix to come and participate in a live experience where we played on RFID tables and I broke down everything that went on in the game. The live class archive features over 10 hours of live video that will reinforce all of the content in the Cash Game Fix in addition to opening your eyes to a wider range of live dynamics at the table. In the live video archive we will be doing the following:</p><strong>Live Breakdowns of School of Cards Players in Real Time!</strong>
          <p>Using the RFID tables I will be conducting live breakdowns of play at the table. Highlighting what they did wrong and what key areas they need to improve their game. I will also be pointing out and identifying live tells and behavioral leaks in their game.</p><strong>A Full Analysis of Players Mistakes and Fixes</strong>
          <p>As we breakdown and address the mistakes players are making in each hand we will be exploring dozens of aspects of poker. Live coaching creates an instant back and forth dialogue that really allows you to work with players games at a deeper level. Through watching these interactions you will gain a full understanding of some of the mistakes and issues you are making at the table as well.</p><strong>A Deep Dive into the Exceptions Principle at the Poker Table</strong>
          <p>Poker isn’t a game that should be played one way. A player's bankroll, skill, financial situation all contribute to specific styles and approaches. One of the reasons School of Sards has been so successful is because we approach teaching poker from a bigger perspective. Due to this approach there are often dozens of exceptions that arise when learning the game. For example, I might tell one player that it's okay to call out of position in that spot and tell another player that they shouldn’t. The exceptions principle is a powerful concept and you will learn exactly how it's applied as you watch the real time application of this principle.</p><strong>The School of Cards Coaching Methodology Applied</strong>
          <p>One of the key variables that has always made School of Cards so special is our unique coaching methodology. A lot of organizations teach poker concepts but they don’t help their students fully integrate and apply those concepts. Watch in real time as I remove student blockages and show you exactly how I get the point to stick.</p>
