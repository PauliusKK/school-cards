            <h1 class="h1-step">The Drills</h1>
            <p class="p-step">Everyday we will release a drill that is designed to improve some aspect of your game. Each drill is dynamic and will focus on all aspects of poker including: foundations, exploitive play, combinatorics, math, nonverbal behavior, poker tells, and much more.  We will review specific spots, create profiles of players, determine equity against a range and do a lot more.</p>
            <ul>Some of the drills include:
                  <li><strong>Spot Extractions -</strong> A spot extraction is when we critically look at a hand a player got into and determine the right outcome for them from their perspective. We will learn about the player’s skill level, bankroll, experience, and the dynamics of the spot that they got into and work through the correct line for them to take. </li>
                  <li><strong>Build Range Profiles -</strong> Range profiles will utilize real footage from the Beyond Tells 2.0 (the largest study ever conducted on poker players) sample which contains players in real games. You will be tasked with watching footage of each player and creating a full breakdown of their game.</li>
                  <li><strong>Mistake Hunting -</strong> In our mistake hunting assignments, we will assess the way a player played the game and look for specific mistakes that were made. Understanding how to identifing a player is going to be that way.</li>

              <div class="question">
                <h4>What happens when it ends? Do I lose access to everything?</h4>
                <p>No. You will have LIFETIME access to all content once the course is over. You will be able to retake it any time and receive all future course updates and improvements for free.</p>
              </div>
              <div class="question">
                <h4>What if I don’t like the course? Can I get my money back?</h4>
                <p>Yes, of course. All of our products offer a full, 30-day money back guarantee. If you don't like the course for any reason you can get a full refund if you are in the 30-day window.</p>
              </div>
              <div class="question">
                <h4>Will I meet other poker players?</h4>
                <p>Definitely. We have a full forum where you can discuss strategy, your progress in the course, meet some poker friends and more.</p>
              </div>
              <div class="question">
                <h4>How much time will I have to dedicate each week?</h4>
                <p>This is completely up to you. The course is set up to be flexible. You should be watching the videos and completing the assignments each week, but if you can’t dedicate as much time in week 4 as you did in week 1, then you can definitely catch up more slowly. Some people may dedicate 2-3 hours per week, while others may dedicate 5-6. It really depends on how quickly you want to absorb all the material and what your own personal learning style is.</p>

              <div class="question">
                <h4>How is the Predictive Edge different from other poker training sites?</h4>
                <p>Poker training sites give you lots of information. The problem is that it’s hard to do anything with information when you have no guidance. You can learn poker concepts anywhere, but there are very few places that teach you how to APPLY those concepts. There is virtually no other site that will provide you with assignments that you can directly use in your everyday play, and personal support on top of that. The Predictive Edge is different because you are not anonymous, you’re not just another number in the system.</p>

              <div class="question">
                <h4>I’m busy. What if I start to fall behind?</h4>
                <p>The course is broken up over 12 weeks, but if life gets in the way and you fall a bit behind don’t worry. Even after the 12 weeks are over, you will have all the videos available to watch, whether you’re catching up on videos you didn’t get to see or you’re refreshing information you’ve already learned. You can also pace the course to do it in 24 weeks. This way you basically just take 2 weeks to do one week of course work.</p>

                <h4>What if I have questions, will there be people that I can go to?</h4>
                <p>We are here to make sure that your questions get answered. If you have any questions about specific content covered in the previous week, you can ask in the sections underneath each assignment. For general questions, we have the Q&amp;A forum. You can also use our internal messaging system to ask us a question directly at any time.</p>

                <h4>Will I get access to the entire course all at once?</h4>
                <p>No, The Predictive Edge is a 12-week workshop. Each week new videos and assignments will be posted. You will be able to access current videos for the week and any previous videos, but videos for future weeks will not be available. At the end of the course, all videos will be available to you for the lifetime of your membership.</p>
