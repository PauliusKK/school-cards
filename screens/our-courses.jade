										q
											| I lost my “fit or fold” predictable image by learning the lessons in the Cash Game Fix by adjusting to the table instead of only playing my cards.  By not playing like a rock, I can extract a ton of value exploiting my opponents’ mistakes, projecting a much looser image.  This Loose Aggressive style often puts me in position to win or steal a lot of pots!

										q
											| The very first thing that struck me is when Blake stressed the importance of the "why?". Usually, in books or sites, authors just explain concepts without going deep into the "why" though it is essential because it's only when you really understand the why of  something that you can apply it correctly. If you follow the program as it is and put in hard work, it is guaranteed you will have results.

										q
											| I like that CGF provides the theory and math behind common scenarios and thought me how to think through them, as opposed to memorizing a bunch of hand charts and playing in autopilot.
